# Web-Application-Pentest

Web Application Penetration testing is the process of using penetration testing techniques on a web application to detect its vulnerabilities. It is similar to a penetration test and aims to break into the web application using any penetration attacks or threats.

Web Application Penetration testing works by using manual or automated penetration tests to identify any vulnerability, security flaws or threats in a web application. The tests involve using/implementing any of the known malicious penetration attacks on the application.
